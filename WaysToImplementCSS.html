            <h1>What different ways of implementing CSS are there?</h1>
            <p>There are three key different ways to implement CSS, these are: in-line, internal and external.</p>

            <h1>In-Line CSS</h1>
            <p>In-Line CSS is used to change the CSS properties within the line of a HTML element. For example you could make text 
                <b style="color: aqua;">C</b><b style="color: cadetblue;">O</b><b style="color: coral;">L</b><b style="color: cadetblue;">O</b><b style="color:darkorange;">U</b><b style="color: fuchsia;">R</b><b style="color:hotpink;">F</b><b style="color:darkorange;">U</b><b style="color: coral;">L</b>
                 without having to set a class and then changing the CSS elsewhere.</p>
            <h2>Advantages to using In-Line CSS</h2>
            <p>There are two key advantages to using In-Line CSS. These are: It's easy to change formatting for one element much easier than other implementation methods, The styling is right next to the element so it makes it easy to change it.</p>
            <h2>Disadvantage to using In-Line CSS</h2>
            <p>There is one significant disadvantage of just using In-Line and that is that if you're using the same styling for multiple elements then it is best to use other implementation elements with classes.</p>

            <h1>Internal CSS</h1>
            <p>Internal CSS is where a tag is used to define an area exclusively for CSS within the html file so it can be used to define stylings for different tags or classes.</p>
            <h2>Advantages of using internal CSS</h2>
            <p>It can make it a lot easier to define styling that apply for the whole page. 
                Another advantage is that, unlike external CSS, when loading the webpage the browser doesn't then need to request the CSS file which will then reduce loading times.</p>
            <h2>Disadvantages of Internal CSS</h2>
            <p>While it is much easier to define styling for a whole file using internal makes it a lot harder for defining a style for a whole website especially if it has a consistent theme. 
                Another disadvantage is that it makes the HTML file a lot longer and untidy.</p>
            
            <h1>External CSS</h1>
            <p>External CSS is where there is a separate file containing all of the styling and that file is then referenced in the HTML file.</p>
            <h2>Advantages of using External CSS</h2>
            <p>There are several key advantages to external CSS mainly that it's easy to create a unified theme among webpages.
                 Another advantage is that all of the styling is separated in a different file so it is more organised.</p>
            <h2>Disadvantages of using External CSS</h2>
            <p>There are 2 disadvantages of External CSS. 
                The main disadvantage is that when loading the webpage the browser needs to request the CSS file which will then increase loading times.
                The other disadvantage is that it's more difficult to change individual elements.</p>
